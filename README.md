Make TagMarks your new speed dial -- beautiful, customizable, taggable,

Installation
============

NOTE: While getting TagMarks up and running is very easy and is meant to be as
simple as possible, there are a few steps you MUST take and details you should
be aware of before running TagMarks in general and *especially* if you deploy it onto a
public-facing webserver.

(This documentation is quite incomplete at the moment.)
