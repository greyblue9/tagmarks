These SVGs were created in Inkscape and that is the only viewer they have been tested with.

The SVGs use linked images for the thumbnails instead of embedding all of the image data in every mockup, and it expects that the thumbnails (from the default thumbnail-set) can be found, relative to the mockups themselves, in the folder "../thumbsets/default". Meaning, one directory above "mockups", you would have the "thumbsets" directory, which has the subdirectory "default" which includes the default thumbnail image set.
